TO DO FOR ASYLUM GAME JAM:

* Plan out more "Scenes".
* Document Limits of the game Engine
* Consider making multiple Chapters, each taking place on a different page. (New Music)
* Possible Mechanic: People become downed, take a couple of turns to get back up.
* Have a reason to have control multiple people.
* Have some scenes towards the beginning that will provide some tension and exposition.
* Make the objective clearer, and more enticing. A good mystery would be good.
* Make the graphics better. Keep it simple, but better.
* Possibility: Add simple lighting system. Give people flashlights?
* Write a good story for the game.
* Give it some more extensive text.
* Try to achieve as many powerful ambient expiereinces as the engine allows.
* Some huge 32x32 maps.
* Variety of perspective, closed in, and also open.
* Add Screams for when the mist closes in on people.
* Have more respect for the audience show.

DONE:
* Play around with enemies

IDEA FOR STORY:

* People are being evacuated.
* They slowly realize it is because of a mist that is continually growing.
* The mist transforms people into weird monsters.

SCENES:

* Walking out of your abandoned neighborhood.
* Following mysterious path down a coast.
* Discovering the mist seeming somewhat innocuous.
* A herd of people running from the mist, running into barriers which make them stumble, Requiring others to jump in front of them.
* 

RULES OF THE ENGINE:
* When you have multiple players, the person the camera is centered on is the one furthest to the left.
